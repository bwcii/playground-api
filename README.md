# About the Project

This project provides a backend api for the [Angular Playground](https://github.com/bwcii/playground) frontend I'm working on to learn web app development. As more components are added to the Angular Playground, this api will increase in functionality and help give me the experience needed for full stack development. I still have a ton to learn, but I'll get there with practice!

# Built With GCP

This api is designed to be deployed to GCP on Cloud Run. Eventually, I'd like this to be deployed via terrafor or another IaC framework, but for now deployment is handled via source deployment with cloud build. Hence the lack of a cloudbuild.yaml build file.
